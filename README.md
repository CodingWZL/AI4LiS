# AI4LiS
In this work, to accelerate the intrinsic modulation of catalysts in Li-S batteries for optimizing the adsorption capacity in local chemical environments, the macroscopic features of elemental ratios, crystal structures and facets were transformed into local coordination structures to fundamentally elucidate the mechanisms, and the machine learning model is employed to predict and interpret the interactions of catalyst-LiPS (Li2S6) and catalyst-solvent (DOL).

# DOL and Li2S6
descriptor.py: calculate the designed hybrid multi-view descriptor (HMVD) that describes compositional, structural, and binding features.

model.py: train the model by using five-fold cross-validations.
